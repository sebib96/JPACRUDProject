# JPACRUDProject
## Description
For this project I designed my own one table database using MySQL and connected it to a website. The site features CRUD operations that persist in the MySQL database. The database consists of some of the books I have in my home library and show a given books title, description, author, release year, genre, and ISBN. A user can also create their own book and add it to the database. 

## Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson learned for this project was HTML and CSS properties and formatting. My main focus has been learning the back end of web development that I had neglected front end design. The more I worked on this project the more features I wanted to implement for the user, visually and functionally. I learned how containers in HTML allow for styling to be a lot more streamlined. I learned attributes are available to me when dealing with text and/or images. I also learned how to make collapsable and functional buttons.
